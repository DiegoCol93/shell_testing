#### `simple_shell` testing area

### Description
simple_shell is a command line interpreter, or shell, in the tradition of the first Unix shell written by Ken Thompson in 1971. This shell is intentionally minimalistic, yet includes the basic functionality of a traditional Unix-like command line user interface.

### Environment
`simple_shell` has been tested on Ubuntu 14.04.6 and 18.04.3 LTS
Done and tested with VirtualBox on Ubuntu via Vagrant(2.2.10)
